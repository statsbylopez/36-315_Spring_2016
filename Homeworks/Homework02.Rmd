#  Homework 02:  Introduction to `ggplot` and 1-D Categorical Data

***General instructions for homeworks***: 

+  Use this file as the template for your lab submission.  Delete the unecessary text (e.g. this text, the problem statements, etc).  That said, keep the nicely formatted "Problem 1", "Problem 2", "a.", "b.", etc
+  Submit two files to Blackboard:  (1) an `R` Markdown file (named as:  [AndrewID]-HW02.Rmd -- e.g. "sventura-HW02.Rmd"), and (2) the corresponding .html file generated from `R` Markdown (named as:  [AndrewID]-HW02.html -- e.g. "sventura-Lab02.html") to Blackboard in the Homework 02 submission section on Blackboard.  You are also welcome to upload a single .zip file containing both of these.
+  Your file should contain the code/commands to answer each question in its own code block; your code should produce plots that will be automatically embedded in the output file
+  Each answer must be supported by written statements (unless otherwise specified)
+  Include the name of anyone you collaborated with at the top of the assignment
+  For Homework 01 only, do not worry about adhering to a particular style guide.  We will cover this next week.

#  Problem 1

**`R` Style Guides:  Google vs. Hadley**:  

One important step in facilitating reproducible research is writing easily readable, well-documented code.  To ensure that you do this, you are required (for the rest of the semester) to adhere to one of the following two `R` Style Guides:

Google's `R` Style Guide:  [https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml]

Hadley Wickham's Advanced `R` Style Guide:  [http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html]

a.  (9 points)  What are the main differences between these two style guides?  Find at least 5 differences.
b.  (1 point)  Specify which style guide you will be using in this assignment.

Assignments not adhereing to the specified style guide will be docked up to 10 points.


#  Problem 2

**Critiquing Graphs**:

Find a graph from the internet (last 7 days -- e.g. a news article, blog post, etc) or from an academic journal (last 60 days).  Describe and critique your graph:

a.  (5 points)  **Include the graph in your assignment**.  Two choices here:  (1) embed the graph/image in the .html file (see below for instructions) and submit it along with your other files on Blackboard, or (2) include a link to the graph in your answer to this question.
b.  (5 points)  **Describe the graph**.  What does the graph show?  What variables are plotted on the axes, via color, or via other features of the graph?
c.  (5 points)  **Critique the graph**.  Does the graph do a good job of achieving its goals?  Does the graph use an unnecessary amount of data ink?  Does the graph distort the actual effect/data/relationship?  What are the strengths and weaknesses (if any) of the graphic?  What would you change (if anything) about this graphic?
d.  (5 points)  **Critique the caption and/or surrounding text**.  Does the text enhance the user's understanding of the graphic?  What else would you include in the caption/surrounding text to help the viewer understand the graphic?

To include an image from the internet in your `R` Markdown output, use the following code (adjust the width and height as necessary):

(Note:  If you're viewing the .html file, you'll see CMU's logo below; the code is in the .Rmd file.)

<div style="width:200px; height=200px">

</div>

#  Problem 3

**Bar Charts**:  

a.  (2 points)  Load the Twitter / Airline Sentiment data from Lab02.  How many rows does the dataset have?  How many columns does the dataset have?

b.  (5 points)  Create a bar chart of the `airline` variable.  Be that your axes are properly labeled, and that the graph has a proper title.  Make sure that each bar in the graph has the same color -- not different colors, as we did in Lab.  To do this, use `+ geom_bar(stat = "count", fill = "red", colour = "black")'.  Change the `fill` and `colour` commands.  What do each of them do?

c.  (3 points)  You can also specify HEX color values when choosing a color, e.g. `fill = "#4169E1"`.  Use a website like [http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_colorvalues.asp] to pick a color of your choice, and fill the bars with that color.


#  Problem 4

**Spine Charts**:  

Spine Charts are similar to Bar Charts.  We'll cover them in class on Monday.  

With a spine chart, we have a single (vertical) bar and multiple stacked, horizontal bars.  To do this, change the `aes` arguments, e.g.:

`aes(x = factor(1), fill = my_variable)`

This will create a single bar on the x-axis and fill the bar in with colors corresponding to whatever categorical values are in `my_variable`.

a.  (5 points)  Re-create the graph from Problem 3, but use a spine chart.  Be sure to correctly label the axes -- remember, their interpretation may have changed from Problem 3.  Include an appropriate title.

b.  (5 points)  In a spine chart, what are the widths of the bars proportional to (if anything)?  What are the heights of the bars proportional to (if anything)?  How is this different from a bar chart?

c.  (BONUS:  1 point)  Remove the ugly `factor(1)` from the x-axis label, without changing the rest of the graphic.



#  Problem 5

**Rose Diagrams**:  

a.  (5 points)  Re-create the graph from Problem 3, but use a rose diagram.  Be sure to correctly label the axes, if necessary.  Include an appropriate title.

b.  (5 points)  In a rose diagram, what does the radius of each rose petal correspond to (if anything)?  What does the angle associated with each rose petal correspond to (if anything)?



#  Problem 6

**Pie Charts**:  

To create a pie chart, use a similar technique to what you used to create a spine chart in Problem 4.

a.  (5 points)  Re-create the graph from Problem 3, but use a pie chart.  Be sure to correctly label the axes, if necessary.  Include an appropriate title.

b.  (5 points)  In a pie chart, what does the radius of each pie slice correspond to (if anything)?  What does the angle associated with each pie slice correspond to (if anything)?

c.  (5 points)  Summarize the differences between a rose diagram and a pie chart in no more than two sentences.

d.  (20 points)  Of the four graphs we used to visualize the `airline` variable, which do you prefer?  Why?  Discuss the strenghts (if any) and weaknesses (if any) of each.


#  Problem 7

**Statistical Tests**:

Your friend says to you, "The airlines are all equally likely to be tweeted about."  

You obviously disagree.  You show your friend your graphs from the previous four problems, but your friend is still unconvinced, and wants to know if the differences across the airlines in your graph are statistically significant.  

(5 points)  What kind of statistical test could you use to show that the airlines are not equally likely to be tweeted about?
